1) first page must be a welcome page if just visiting the site for first time
    Two options: Generate a new room or join an existing room
    User must also create their own name(kinda like a login page?)

    JOIN ROOM: enter a code and then check with the server if it exists
    CREATE ROOM: generate a room and give the user a code to give to their friends

2) second page
    Actual room with other people

    Room has a chat log with users, a video player and a queue


databases:

table 1: Rooms
id: integer
code: unqiue string for the room | primary key
users: relates to the users table(many users to one room relationship)
host_id: id of the host_id
room_started: has the room started
current video: the id of the current video


table 2: Users:
id(unique primary key)
name of user
room code = code of the room they are in

redis:
video queue: json with video id and the link to the playlist/video
key: video id
value: json
